Changes since the last public release (1.2.42):

version 1.2.43 [February 25, 2010]

  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Removed "#ifdef PNG_1_0_X / #endif" surrounding
    PNG_READ_16_TO_8_SUPPORTED and PNG_READ_GRAY_TO_RGB_SUPPORTED
    in pngconf.h.  These were added in libpng-1.2.41beta08 and libpng-1.0.51,
    which introduced a binary incompatibility with libpng-1.0.50.
  Backported two-pass png_decompress_chunk() algorithm from libpng-1.4.1
  Removed PNGAPI declaration of png_calloc() and png_write_sig() in
    1ibpng-1.2.X, introduced by mistake in libpng-1.2.41.
  Return allocated "old_buffer" in png_push_save_buffer() before png_error(),
    to avoid a potential memory leak.
  Ported rewritten png_decompress_chunk() by John Bowler from libpng-1.4.1.
  Define _ALL_SOURCE in configure.ac, makefile.aix, and CMakeLists.txt
    when using AIX compiler.
  Removed unused gzio.c from contrib/pngminim gather and makefile scripts
