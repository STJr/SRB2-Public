/******************************************************************************\

 CodeImp Doom Builder

 Game Configuration for SRB2 version 2.0.

 Original CFG by Kristos

 Edited by Shadow Hog to eliminate one NASTY map header-eliminating bug

 Edited further by ST218 to make more organized

 Edited by Foxboy to show thing sprite previews and to update it for srb2 1.09.2
 and 1.09.3.4.

 Edited by JJames19119 to fix parse errors, thing and linedef names, fix borked
 lindef categories, add the missing PASSUSE linedef flag and put bitset flags
 for the lazy :P

 Edited by SRB2-Playah to make Things visible in 3D Mode, add Mario section
 because I think it'd be more organized, changed a few names, put in a list of
 Color Values in the Things section of this CFG, and to put it large lines to
 make it easier to find stuff in the CFG and thusly, easier to edit.
 <SRB2-Playah> Dang, this was just edited to heck, wasn't it? :P

 Edited by Oogaland to support features of the modified DB.
 Compatibility with vanilla DB is now broken.

 Edited by SSNTails to reflect v2.0 changes.

 Edited by DarkWarrior to organize the linedef types. Yay! I get to be important
 and contribute! :D

TEXTURES AND FLAT SOURCES-------------------------------------------------------
This tells Doom Builder where to find the information for textures
and flats in the IWAD file, Addition WAD file and Map WAD file.

Start and end lumps must be given in a structure (of which the
key name doesnt matter) and any textures or flats in between them
are loaded in either the textures category or flats category.

For textures: PNAMES, TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2 are loaded by default.

}

/*
TEXTURES AND FLATS FILTERING----------------------------------------------------
This allows you to filter textures and flats so that you only see the
textures/flats listed that you prefer to use.

The key name doesnt matter here, only the values. You can use
the following wildcards in values to specify ranges:

? = Any character
* = Zero or more characters
# = Any numeric digit
[abc...] = Any of these characters that are between brackets
[!abc..] = Not any of these characters that are between brackets
*/

// List these textures...

as invalid. Pattern-matching is performed.

GAME DETECT PATTERN-------------------------------------------------------------
Used to guess the game for which a WAD file is made.

Pattern-matching is now performed on lump names. See above for syntax.

/*
MAP LUMP NAMES------------------------------------------------------------------
Map lumps are loaded with the map as long as they are right after each other.
When the editor meets a lump which is not defined in this list (or defined as 0)
it will stop loading right there.

The order of items defines the order in which lumps will be written to WAD file
on save. The value (flags) of items determines what the editor should do with
it. You should never mess with value 4, because it may result in incorrect map
builds.

1 = Lump required
2 = Lump which must be respected
4 = Lump generated by node builder
8 = Lump allowed to be empty after nodebuilding
16 = Lump allowed to be missing after nodebuilding
4096 = Lump which can be edited as text
8192 = Lump which can be edited as DEHACKED
12288 = Lump which can be edited as MAPINFO
16384 = WAD-global.
